Banfield (December 1827 \u2013 March 4, 1883) was an American soldier, law enforcement officer, police sergeant and founding member of the New York City Police Department \"Steamboat Squad\". Born in England, he emigrated to the United States as a child. He worked as a painter in his youth and later served in the Mexican-American War. He lived in California for a time before returning the New York to join the police force in June 1857. He was first assigned to the Eleventh Ward under Captain , where he was appointed a sergeant, and served as acting precinct captain before being transferred to the Eighteenth Precinct commanded by Captain John Cameron. During the New York Draft Riots in 1863, the station house was destroyed by rioters. While the precinct was being attacked, Banfield had been ordered to guard the State Armory, then considered a likely target by the rioters, and held the building until he and his 20-man police force were relieved by the Broadway Squad under Sergeant Cornelious Burdick at around 2:00 am. Banfield was made acting precinct captain of the Twenty-Third Precinct when Captain Palmer was dismissed from the force due to cowardice. He and Sergeant William Jamieson both competed to win the position on a permanent basis, a rivalry which Jamieson eventually won, and Banfield was sent back to the Eighteenth Precinct after Captain took command of the Twenty-First Precinct. Once again under Captain Cameron's command, Banfield remained one of his closest officers until his death in 1871. He spent time in the First, Seventh and Thirteenth Precincts until joining the \"Steamboat Squad\" under Sergeant George W. Gastlin. The squad was a special unit formed by Police Commissioner Joel B. Erhardt for the purpose of combating river pirates and criminal gangs active on the New York waterfront.

Her first mainstream single, \"Smile\", reached number one on the UK Singles Chart in July 2006. Her debut record, Alright, Still, was well received, selling over 2.6 million copies worldwide and bringing Allen nominations at the Grammy Awards, the Brit Awards, and the MTV Video Music Awards. In 2009, her second studio album\u2014It's Not Me, It's You\u2014saw a genre shift, having more of an electropop feel, rather than the ska and reggae influences of the first one. The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and the Australian ARIA Charts and was well received by critics, noting the singer's musical evolution and maturity. It spawned the hit singles \"The Fear\", \"Not Fair\" and \"Fuck You\". This success saw her receive the Brit Award for British Female Solo Artist at the 2010 Brit Awards. Allen and Amy Winehouse were credited with starting a process that led to the \"year of the women\" media label in 2009 that saw five female artists making music of \"experimentalism and fearlessness\" nominated for the Mercury Prize. She has released two further albums: Sheezus (2014), which debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, and No Shame (2018) debuting at number eight. Allen also ventured into other careers; in 2008, she hosted her own television talk show, Lily Allen and Friends, on BBC Three before launching her own record label, In the Name Of, in 2011. In 2018, Allen released her autobiographical book, My Thoughts Exactly. Allen has since resumed her screen acting career from 1998; she appeared in the 2019 film How to Build a Girl.
