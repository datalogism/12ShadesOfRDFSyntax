His lab solved the structure of the pancreatic enzyme ribonuclease A, the third protein structure ever solved by protein crystallography.Harker was a member of the National Academy of Sciences,director of the protein structure program at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, director of the Center for Crystallographic Research at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the head of the crystallography division of General Electric. After retirement from Roswell Park in 1976, he joined the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute (HWI), then known as the Medical Foundation of Buffalo.

His writing is considered original in that it combines the dramatic and sentimental spirit of Romanticism with a highly personal combination of sarcasm, bitterness and dark humour. He is also celebrated for his peculiar wit and anecdotal character, as well as for his turbulent (and ultimately tragical) life. His writing, which is centred in the local and the picturesque and is in a general sense affiliated with the Romantic tradition, is often regarded in contrast to that of E\u00e7a de Queiroz \u2013 a cosmopolitan dandy and a fervorous proponent of Realism, who was Camilo's literary contemporary in spite of being 20 years younger. In this tension between Camilo and E\u00e7a \u2013 often dubbed by critics the literary guerrilla \u2013 many have interpreted a synthesis of the two great tendencies present in the Portuguese literature of the 19th century. Allegations that he was initiated in Freemasonry in 1846, are somewhat contradictory as there are indications that, around the same time, during the Revolution of Maria da Fonte, he fought in favor of the Miguelists as \"helper to the orders of the Scottish General \", who was active in the revived Order of Saint Michael of the Wing precisely to combat Masonry.

Considered one of the most important and beloved LGBT icons in Spain, she rose to fame in 1996 after briefly appearing on the late-night talk show Esta noche cruzamos el Mississippi, broadcast on Telecinco between 1995 and 1997 and hosted by the journalist Pepe Navarro. She would later appear regularly on the show as well as on La sonrisa del pel\u00edcano. Distinguished for her spectacular appearance and profane humor, La Veneno was one of the first transgender women to become widely known in Spain, and has since been recognised as a pioneering trans icon. In 2020, a critically acclaimed series produced by Atresmedia following her life became a hit show in Spain.", "ent": "La_Veneno"}]
